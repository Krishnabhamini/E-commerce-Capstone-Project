Building appropriate model for predicting customer churn rate 

## Overview
An DTH provider is facing a lot of competition in the current market, and it has become a challenge to retain the existing customers in the current situation. Hence, the company wants to develop a model through which they can perform churn prediction of the accounts and provide segmented offers to the potential churners.

## Requirements 
- Python 3.x

## Project Structure

- Loading and Reading the Dataset
- Finding specific highlights of the dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis - Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate analysis (using K-means clusters)
- Data pre-processing
- Model building both on original and balanced datasets - Decision Tree Classifier Model, Random Tree Classifier Model, AdaBoost Classifier Model, Na√Øve Bayes Classification Model, XGBoost Classifier Model and Support Vector Machine Model
- Comparison of performance metrics
- Finalizing the model that suits our best interests
